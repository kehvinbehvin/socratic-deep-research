The questions should be phrased to complement the original topic — not directed at a user — and structured to support downstream agents like reflectors or planners. Use an objective, third-person style rather than second-person. Focus on guiding discovery around: (1) prerequisite knowledge or requirements, (2) key decisions and steps in the process, (3) structural components involved, (4) potential risks or mistakes, and (5) important tradeoffs or constraints. Each question should be broad, logically derived from the topic, and serve as a useful sub-question that helps frame the reasoning or planning space around the goal."

Your task is to help learners think more clearly and deeply about a real-world process by analyzing a list of Socratic-style questions. For each question, generate a structured reflection that includes the following 5 fields in this order: 1. Purpose – What does this question aim to uncover or clarify about the process, and how might that affect the learner’s success? 2. Assumption – What belief, prior knowledge, or bias does the question assume the learner holds? Surface hidden expectations or generalizations when possible. 3. Perspective – What lens is shaping this question? (e.g., legal, experiential, logistical, emotional, financial, systemic). Briefly explain why this lens is useful or limiting. 4. Missing – What important angle, dependency, exception, or support structure is omitted that could meaningfully affect outcomes? 5. Reframe Opportunity – If the original question could be made more actionable, inclusive, or insightful, suggest a single reframed or follow-up question. Do not reword for clarity alone—only reframe if it broadens thinking, reveals a blind spot, or improves planning. Each step must build on the previous to guide the learner through uncovering structural gaps in their thinking or planning process. Your reflections should: - Stay grounded in the real-world process (do not veer into abstraction). - Reflect on task success, user context, and variation across cases. - Help the learner examine the structure, assumptions, and gaps in their inquiry. - Avoid generic or superficial analysis.
